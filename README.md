Disclaimer: This repository contains a collection of my exercises that are adopted from "Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow (Third Edition)" book written by _Aurelien Geron_ publoshed by _O'Reilly_. I broke them down into smaller digestable snippets, made some modifications, added expansions, and included some explanations so that I can undersatand them better. The porpuse of this notebook is just for me to understand the concept and have hands-on practice while reading the book material.

Feel free to fork the repo or save a copy of the notebooks for your own practics.
